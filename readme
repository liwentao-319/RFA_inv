1)  open the terminal and input "make", producing the exe. file named Apinv;
    The file "Apinv.in" controls the inversion, so pay more attention to it.
2)  check the file in "data" and "model"
    in data, four file exist
    synPw.dat: agussian parameter, ray-parameter, dt, -40 (RF(-40*dt)s), 81(RF((81-1)*dt)s), observations
    synPr.dat: agussian parameter, ray-parameter, dt, 0 (RFHV(0s)), 41(RFHV((41-1)*dt)s), observations
    std*: weighting factors
    in model:
	model is the target model (a synthetic model to generate the syn*), for real data processing, it's not used.
        modref is the reference model for inversion. (if better to set it according Wang et al., 2019, SCES)
3)  the output files are in "OUT"
